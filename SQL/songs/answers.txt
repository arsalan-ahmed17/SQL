If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

To characterize their audio aura, I would calculate the average values for energy, valence, and danceability from the
songs.db data. Based on the results, I would determine their dominant moods by correlating these averages with the mood
categories described in Spotify Wrapped (e.g., high energy and valence might indicate a "happy" aura, while low energy and
high valence might reflect "calm" or "introspective" traits). For example, if the average energy is high and the valence is
moderate, the aura might lean towards "orange" or "purple."


Why might the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura not be very representative of the listener?

This calculation might not fully represent the listener for several reasons. First, it relies on just three numerical metrics
(energy, valence, danceability), which oversimplifies the emotional and personal nuances of music. Second, the data only reflects
the listener's preferences in 2018, which may not align with their current tastes or emotional state. Third, the method
doesn't account for genre diversity, lyrical content, or the emotional context in which the music was consumed.


What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

A more representative approach would include additional factors such as lyrical sentiment analysis, tempo, and genre
classifications. Weighting recent listening data more heavily could also provide a better snapshot of the listener's current
state. Additionally, incorporating user feedback or self-reported moods alongside their music preferences would help create a
more personalized and accurate audio aura.
